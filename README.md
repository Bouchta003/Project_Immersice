# Immersive Experiences - Zeppelix Escape Game
## Overview
The **Zeppelix Team's** Escape Game is an immersive virtual experience inspired by the world of the Gauls and Romans, with elements drawn from the iconic *Asterix & Obelix* series.

## Game Storyline
You are a Roman soldier caught spying on the Gaulish druid Piquenix. Trapped inside his house, your mission is to solve various puzzles to recreate a magical teleportation potion and escape back to your camp.

## Gameplay Features
### 1. Design Choices
- **Environment**: A Roman camp and druid’s house inspired by *Asterix & Obelix*, featuring tents, wooden towers, and walls.
- **Druid’s House**: Set at the forest's edge, filled with potions, relics, and Roman artifacts.
- **Assets**: Utilizes both custom-made items (like a menhir and marble plaques) and free assets from the Unity Asset Store.
  
### 2. Puzzles
- **Puzzle 1: Roman Gods**\
Players must place items associated with Roman gods in the correct order on numbered sockets to reveal a critical potion ingredient.
- **Puzzle 2: Teleportation Potion**\
Involves selecting and combining the correct potions from around the room in a cauldron to create a teleportation potion. A successful combination reveals the potion, while a wrong one resets the puzzle.

### 3. Challenges
- **Collider Issues**: The player can accidentally pass through certain walls despite various collider implementations.
